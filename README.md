FlatSQL
=======

/**
* @author Bastian Christoph
*
* This project implements a SQL helper class that is basically designed 
* in order to simplify the SQL notation.
*
* The fact should not be changed, that the SQL formulation is
* kept as flat as possible with a low degree of abstraction
* in order to develop effective methods for bottleneck-identification
* and performance-improvements for database-related applications.
*
* Using the padding character '_' in the names we want to ensure
* intuitive formatting- alignment in the notation.
*
* Intuitively the SQL-clauses should be expandable over IDE-recommendation
